<h1>On the verge of a new era: freedom tsunami or schemed alienation?</h1>

<header>
    <p>We have front row seats to an exciting historical moment, seeing the role of technology in empowering social unrest. Are 20th century responses efficient solutions to 21st century protests?</p>

<p>On the 14th of October, thousands of Catalan protesters <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c6F44b7HcQ">peacefully occupied the second largest Spanish Airport</a>, El Prat in Barcelona. They managed to successfully block the building resulting in the cancellation of over a hundred flights. <strong>The flash meet-up was organized exclusively using digital channels</strong> by an anonymous, and to this date unknown organization: <strong>Tsunami Democràtic</strong>.</p>

<p>Days later, while the Spanish authorities were discussing police action and hinted towards <a href="https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/10/19/inenglish/1571484159_002176.html">the application of the anti-terrorist laws and tribunals</a>, the anonymous activists where on the other hand, focusing their efforts on <strong>improving and publishing their mobile app</strong>. It is based in a complex friend-to-friend (F2F) architecture that decentralizes and anonymizes information broadcasting with the use of asymmetric cryptography and distributed networks.</p>

<p>And while the conventional political commentators still debated on television the taking of the airport as if it was just another angry mob, Tsunami Democràtic <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tsunami-democratic-app">arrived at Product Hunt <strong>and became global</strong></a>, <strong>their source code was published</strong> on Github accessible for all and their Telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/tsunamid">surpassed 400.000 members</a>, one of the most active in the world. Like in Hong Kong previously, for the first time technology took a pivotal role in the long tradition of European social revolts.</p>

<p>This Wednesday El Clásico will take place in Barcelona: the soccer match between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. One of the most important sporting events in the world with an estimated audience of <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2017/04/25/football/1493125489_498853.html">more than 650 million spectators from 185 countries</a>. Both teams will play soccer while police and demonstrators will play a game of cat-and-mouse. Nobody knows for certain what will happen after Tsunami Democràtic ambiguously called for <q>everyone to play the match</q>.</p>

<p>Neither do we know who is behind Tsunami Democràtic. <strong>Are we in front of a freedom tsunami that empowers self-managed citizens, or on the verge of a sophisticated era of schemed alienation?</strong></p>

<p>The Spanish judiciary took 24 hours to shut Tsunami Democràtic's website: a record for an institution whose time frames are usually measured in months and years. The activists, on the other hand, <strong>took no more than 5 minutes to reopen it again</strong>, and dozens of replicas flourished in a more than expected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand Effect</a>. <strong>Are 20th century laws and procedures efficient for 21th century protests?</strong></p>

<p>By court order <a href="http://tsunamidemocratic.cat"><cite>tsunamidemocratic.cat</cite></a> website <strong>cannot be accessed from Spain</strong>, but not from other countries. The measure, trivial to bypass, seems to suppose the modern reedition of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum">Index Librorum Prohibitorum</a> in one of the most important democracies in the world. <strong>Does it make sense to impose national jurisdictions in a liquid medium like internet?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Only this autumn</strong>, over a million people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/25/chile-protests-congress-valparaiso-police">took to the streets throughout Chile</a> to protest in a coordinated campaign, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/21/hong-kong-protests-police-fire-water-cannon-with-blue-dye-as-crowds-defy-ban">crowds in Hong Kong defied the police</a> in massive marches, and tens of thousands of Catalan protesters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/catalan-separatist-leaders-given-lengthy-prison-sentences#maincontent">occupied the second largest Spanish Airport</a>. <strong>The flash meet-ups have been organized mainly using digital channels</strong>, and in the case of Catalonia by an anonymous, and to this date unknown organization: <strong>Tsunami Democràtic</strong>.</p>

<p>Regarding Catalonia, while the Spanish authorities were discussing police action and hinted towards <a href="https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/10/19/inenglish/1571484159_002176.html">the application of the anti-terrorist laws and tribunals</a>, the anonymous activists where on the other hand, focusing their efforts on <strong>improving and publishing their mobile app</strong>. It is based in a complex friend-to-friend (F2F) architecture that decentralizes and anonymizes information broadcasting with the use of asymmetric cryptography and distributed networks.</p>

<p>And while the conventional political commentators still debated on television the taking of the airport as if it was just another angry mob, the protester’s app <strong><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tsunami-democratic-app">became global</a>, their source code was published</strong> on Github accessible for all and their Telegram channel <a href="https://t.me/tsunamid">surpassed 410,000 members</a>, one of the most active in the world.</p>

<p><strong>For the first time technology is playing a pivotal role in the empowerment of social revolts worldwide</strong>. Are we in front of a freedom tsunami that empowers self-managed citizens, or on the verge of a sophisticated era of schemed alienation? Are 20th century laws and procedures efficient for 21th century protests? Does it make sense to impose national jurisdictions in a liquid medium like the internet?</p>
