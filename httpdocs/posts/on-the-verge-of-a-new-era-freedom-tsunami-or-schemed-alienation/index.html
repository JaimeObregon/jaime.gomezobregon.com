<h1>On the verge of a new era: freedom tsunami or schemed alienation?</h1>

We have front row seats to an exciting historical moment, seeing the role of technology in empowering social unrest. Are 20th century responses efficient solutions to 21st century protests?

Only this autumn, over a million people took to the streets throughout Chile to protest in a coordinated campaign, crowds in Hong Kong defied the police in massive marches, and tens of thousands of Catalan protesters occupied the second largest Spanish Airport. The flash meet-ups have been organized mainly using digital channels, and in the case of Catalonia by an anonymous, and to this date unknown organization: Tsunami Democràtic.

Regarding Catalonia, while the Spanish authorities were discussing police action and hinted towards the application of the anti-terrorist laws and tribunals, the anonymous activists where on the other hand, focusing their efforts on improving and publishing their mobile app. It is based in a complex friend-to-friend (F2F) architecture that decentralizes and anonymizes information broadcasting with the use of asymmetric cryptography and distributed networks.

And while the conventional political commentators still debated on television the taking of the airport as if it was just another angry mob, the protester’s app became global, their source code was published on Github accessible for all and their Telegram channel surpassed 410,000 members, one of the most active in the world.

For the first time technology is playing a pivotal role in the empowerment of social revolts worldwide. Are we in front of a freedom tsunami that empowers self-managed citizens, or on the verge of a sophisticated era of schemed alienation? Are 20th century laws and procedures efficient for 21th century protests? Does it make sense to impose national jurisdictions in a liquid medium like the internet?


Why this vision is timely and relevant

The opinion here pitched refers to ongoing events worldwide, and even this week pegged into one of the most important events in the sporting calendar: Last Wednesday’s FC Barcelona and Real Madrid soccer match held in Catalonia, with an estimated global audience of more than 650 million people from 185 countries.

I am a geek at heart, a technologist and I have also observed for years the Catalan independence movement from an intellectual, non-partisan perspective. My original insights became quickly viral on Twitter and connected in moderation two vast social masses often emotionally confronted.

Also, my proposal for this piece aims to offer something rare: an original, balanced opinion setting forth questions rather than providing certainties. Placing a big question mark in light of the many uncertainties that this exciting future awaits us.
