    <p>
        On August 23, 1973, Jan Erik <i>Janne</i> Olsson, on leave from prison,
        walked into Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg, central Stockholm and
        attempted to hold up the bank. Swedish police were called in
        immediately, two of them went inside, and Olsson opened fire, injuring
        one policeman. The other was ordered to sit in a chair and "sing
        something". He started singing "Lonesome Cowboy". Olsson then took 4
        people as hostages. He demanded his friend Clark Olofsson to be brought
        there, along with 3 million Swedish Kronor ($730,000 US 1973 value), two
        guns, bullet-proof vests, helmets and a fast car.

        Both Olsson and Olofsson were charged, convicted and sentenced to
        extended prison terms for the robbery. Olsson was sentenced to 10 years
        in prison. He received many admiring letters from women who found him
        attractive.
        <strong>He later married to one of his female admirers.</strong>
