<p>It was about a decade ago when I met a crazy guy from whom I have very special memories. That was in the remote lands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suchov">Suchov</a>, a tiny remote village fifty miles away from Brno, Czech Republic.</p>

<p>Dimitrij, a youngster in his twenties at that time, escaped from Russia and probably from being imprisoned due to some sort of issue with local authorities which I cannot remember.</p>

<p>I was one of the ten or twelve volunteers doing maintenance work in a medieval settlement in the nearby. The group's headquarter was established in the facilities of an old school from the communist era, where we lived for two weeks, sleeping in military bags from the cold war.</p>

<p>One night I got woken up during the night by a distant, strange melody. I walked upstairs and I found him sitting on the floor, alone in the darkness and almost nude, playing his trumpet softly.</p>

<p>Despite we have never been in contact again since then, tonight I accidentally found his email address in an archived diary. I have no other form of contact so, after some hesitation, I decided to drop him a line:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>Hi! I'm wondering if a cool guy I met on Suchov, Czech Republic, about twelve years ago is Still alive and kicking. Dimitrij, is it you? :-)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Surprisingly it took only some minutes to receive an answer:</p>

<blockquote>
